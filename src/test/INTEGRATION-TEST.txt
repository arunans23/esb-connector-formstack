Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB Formstack connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
   https://github.com/wso2/esb-connectors/tree/master/integration-base

Tested Platform: 

 - Microsoft WINDOWS V-7
 - UBUNTU 14.04, Mac OSx 10.10.3
 - WSO2 ESB 4.9.0, ESB 5.0.0-BETA

Steps to follow in setting integration test.

 1. Download WSO2 ESB 5.0.0-BETA from official site. Extract the ESB and put "-XX:-UseSplitVerifier" under $JVM_MEM_OPTS into {ESB_HOME}/bin/wso2server.sh

 2. Deploy relevant patches, if applicable and the ESB should be configured as below.

 3. Follow the below mentioned steps for adding valid certificate to access formstack API over https.

    i)   Extract the certificate from browser(Mozilla Firefox) by navigating to https://www.formstack.com
    ii)  Go to new ESB 5.0.0-BETA folder and place the downloaded certificate in both "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" and "{FORMSTACK_CONNECTOR_HOME}/formstack-connector/formstack-connector-1.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" folders.
    iii) Navigate to "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import formstack certificate in to keystore.
         Give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

         NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from formstack. (e.g. *.formstack.com)
                CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. formstack)

    iv) Navigate to "{FORMSTACK_CONNECTOR_HOME}/formstack-connector/formstack-connector-1.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import Formstack certificate in to keystore.
        Give "wso2carbon" as password.

        NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from formstack, change it accordingly. (e.g. *.formstack.com)
               CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. formstack)
    
    v) Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-5.0.0-BETA.zip and copy that zip file in to location "{ESB_CONNECTOR_HOME}/repository/".

 4. Create a formstack trial account and derive the API Token.
   i)    Using the URL "https://www.formstack.com/" create an formstack trial account.
   ii)   In the account homepage click on user icon, choose 'API' and create a 'New Application'. Fill all the mandatory fields and 'Create Application'. Get the Access token from the next screen and retain it for further use.
   iii)  Create a new folder in formstack account (click on 'New Folder' in Forms section).
   iv)   Create a new form inside the folder created in 3. iii)
         - When creating a form, it should have at least 3 text fields (onto which data has to be entered when submitting).
         - A form can also be created from an existing template but please make sure that there are at least 3 text fields in the form.
         - All the fields which are going to get created should not be 'hidden', 'required' or 'readonly'.
   v)    Form created in 4. iv) should have at least 2 submissions before executing the test suite.
         - Data should be entered into all the text field of the form when making a submission.
   vi)   Create a sample form which will be deleted when the integration test is executing. (click on 'New Form' in Forms section).
